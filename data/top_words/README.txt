Info:

The top n words test is a stricter test than the dictionary test, but since
our language is known to obey a power law distribution, there's huge 
benefit to using a smaller comparison set. Oxford and Brown both state that
comparing with just a vocabulary of the top 100 words, a standard English
corpus (ignoring proper nouns) will match 50% of its values with just those
100 words. OED also states that the top 1000 words match 75% of text.


Notes: 

Top words lists sorted alphabetically, lower case, no punctuation.
